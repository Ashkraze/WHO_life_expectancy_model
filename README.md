WHO Life Expectancy Prediction Using Linear Regression

In this project, I developed a model to predict life expectancy using a Linear Regression algorithm. The project involved extensive data engineering to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. Key steps included:

Outlier Treatment: Identifying and handling outliers to maintain data integrity.
Null Value Treatment: Addressing missing values to ensure a complete dataset.
Standardization: Transforming data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
Scaling: Adjusting the range of data features to a standard scale.
Missing Value Treatment using Data Imputation: Filling in missing values with appropriate estimates.
Correlation Treatment: Managing highly correlated features to improve model performance.

After these preprocessing steps, I applied the Linear Regression model to predict life expectancy based on the cleaned and processed data.
